Kenya s commercial banks are on the spot for providing conflicting information on the number of loans given to the private sector in a bid to pour cold water on the fixed interest rate regime. This comes as the debate over whether controlling interest rate will free more money for investment shows no signs of cooling off. The EastAfrican has established that loans to the private sector have been increasing since September 2016, when the law capping interest rates came into force. This is contrary to reports by the Central Bank and the Kenya Bankers Association (KBA) that the private sector has been deprived of credit since banks are not willing to lend to riskier borrowers at a controlled rate. Data collected by the CBK from all lenders shows that credit to private households, real estate, building and construction, finance and insurance, and consumer durables has increased, while loans to a few sectors such as agriculture and manufacturing have remained almost flat. For instance, the number of loans that banks extended to households, real estate and the building and construction sectors increased by six per cent, four per cent and three per cent respectively between September 2016 and February 2017. Interestingly, private households that were branded high risk after the passage of the interest rate law received the lion s share of credit in February 2017, at $4 billion. The sector was followed by trade ($3.76 billion), real estate ($3.42 billion), manufacturing ($2.75 billion), transport and communications ($1.95 billion) and consumer durables ($1.69 billion). Compared with the same period last year (February 2016), all the sectors save agriculture, manufacturing, and mining and quarrying posted growth in the number of loans received from banks. Manufacturing, trade, real estate and households account for 60 per cent of the total credit in the banking sector. Hands are tied The fixing of lending rates at four percentage points above the prevailing central bank rate came after banks failed to heed to pressure from the government to lower their lending rates. The law has since been criticised by banks, the CBK, Treasury and the IMF. Attorney General Githu Muigai said the government s hands are tied and it cannot effect any amendments to the law since it was brought into being through a private member s Bill in parliament. Although data shows that banks have been lending even with the controlled interest rate, the lenders have maintained that the law is unhealthy to the economy and that its enforcement has led to the decline in credit to the private sector.
