Tanzania plans to introduce a 1 per cent clearing fee on the value of mineral exports in 2017/18 (July-June), its finance minister said on Thursday, part of government measures aimed at getting a bigger share of revenues from the country's natural resources. "The government will not allow the direct export of minerals from mines," finance and planning minister Philip Mpango said in his budget speech in parliament. "The government will set up clearing houses at international airports, mines and exit border points where a 1 per cent clearing fee will be imposed on the value of mineral exports." Dr Mpango said the government would announce more details on the new mineral clearing fee at a later date. Last month, President John Magufuli fired his mining minister and the chief of the state-run mineral audit agency after an investigation into possible undeclared exports by mining companies.

Acacia has denied any wrongdoing and said the state's audit of the company's gold and copper ore was inaccurate and has said it would consider its options in the east African country. Ban on gold, copper exports Introduction of the clearing fee also comes after Magufuli ordered a ban on exports of gold and copper concentrates in March to push for domestic value addition of minerals through the construction of a copper smelter.

Major foreign-owned mining companies in Tanzania that will be affected by the requirement to list on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange include Acacia Mining, AngloGold Ashanti and Petra Diamonds. Tanzania is Africa's fourth-biggest gold producer and also has vast deposits of coal, uranium and precious gemstones.
