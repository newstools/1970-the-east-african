Joan sat unmoving, a dark silhouette on top of the large four poster bed. It was so quiet she could hear the strong and steady thud of her heartbeat. A thin silver sliver of moonlight shining on the floor and snaking its way up the wall opposite her was all that illuminated the room. She had been toying with the edges of her dreams, unaware of what was going on around her. Then she heard it, the crunch of footsteps on gravel. Instinctually, she reached out for her husband next to her, a gasp catching in her throat. Henry she whispered, as a sinking feeling washing over her as she touched the empty space in the bed beside her. She d forgotten that he was away on a business trip. She was alone. ************************* Kyle was a bitter man. He had been that way for so long, he d forgotten other ways to be. So this night, his friend Henry s success had brought him here, and he saw very little wrong in his plan. Why should Henry have it all? Heey Ky a whisper came from behind him. Shh! No names, you fool! Kyle hissed, turning around to glare at his companion. The moonlight cast eerie shadows on his face that, coupled with his anger, made him look grotesque. His wiry, ratty looking companion shrank back. Sorr the man begun again, only to be silenced by another withering look. We get in, get the blueprints and get out, Kyle whispered harshly, as he deftly picked the lock on the front door and slowly turned the handle. Joan s senses were on edge. She had been fully awake at the moment that Kyle s companion had whispered to him. Slipping out of bed with her mind in over-drive, she dressed up in seconds, retrieved and loaded Henry s handgun. She padded silently into the hallway to the electrical box and switched off the mains. Just as she was about to go and hide, she heard the front door creak open. She froze; it was a direct view from the front door to the back door in the kitchen where she now stood. The door swung open, letting a flood of moonlight into the dark house. The elongated shadows of the two men were visible. Joan ducked behind the large kitchen island just as Kyle stepped over the threshold. The two men entered the house silently, betrayed only by the sounds of their breathing and the slight creak of the door closing behind them. As their eyes struggled to adjust to the pitch blackness, they stumbled against the entry hallway furniture. The wiry man stubbed his toe and let forth a string of expletives. Rummaging sounds Joan sat unmoving, a dark silhouette on top of the large four poster bed. It was so quiet she could hear the strong and steady thud of her heartbeat.
